reset-audio-balance
===================

A small script and Automator app to reset the audio balance (left/right channel) on Mac OS X.

Background
----------

I have connected a set of Logitech 2.1 speakers to the headphone/line out port of my 2013 MacBook Pro running OS X Yosemite (10.10).

Whenever I disconnect that connection (to take the MBP with me), return home, and reconnect the cables, the system volume balance seems to have run out of order, i.e., is not set to the center but to either the left or the right loudspeaker channel.

This script resets the speaker balance.
